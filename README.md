# 🌍 EcoCommute Pro: AI Sustainability Analytics

### 🏆 1M1B AI for Sustainability Internship Project
**SDG Alignment:** SDG 13 (Climate Action) & SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities)

---

## 📖 Project Overview
**EcoCommute Pro** is a "Fitbit for Carbon"—an AI-powered analytics dashboard that helps students and professionals track, visualize, and reduce their daily transport emissions.

Unlike simple calculators, this tool uses a **Session-Based Itinerary Tracker** to log complex, multi-leg journeys. It features a proprietary **"Eco-Score" Algorithm** that grades user behavior on a scale of 0-100, effectively gamifying the reduction of carbon footprints.

### 🚀 Key Features
* **🧠 AI Eco-Score:** A logic-based scoring engine that evaluates travel efficiency.
* **📊 Interactive Dashboard:** Visualizes transport mix and compares your data against global averages.
* **📍 Multi-Leg Itinerary:** Tracks complex trips (e.g., Walk → Train → Bus).
* **💡 Smart Recommendations:** Context-aware alerts for carpooling and active transport.
* **📥 Export Reports:** Download your carbon profile as a CSV file.
